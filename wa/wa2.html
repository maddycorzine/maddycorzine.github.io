    <h1>Hey, Im Maddy, my pronouns are she/her and I am from LA.</h1>
    <p>
    I came to Boulder cause I love to ski, snowboard and be outside.
    I like to think Im 
   <i>pretty</i> 
    creative, 
    I love to draw, use photoshop, and most things in between. 
    <strong>I dont have any experience with coding,</strong> 
    and so I am so excited for this class. 
    <h4>My goal is to create my own personalized website for my resume and also to deisgn a space for me to document / blog my experiences when I go abroad this upcoming
    Spring Semester, to ...</h4>

    <i>stoked.</i>
    Overall, I am really looking forward
    to expanding my knowledge as it relates to web design and coding. 
    <b>I cant wait.</b>
